## Section 2 – Scope.

### License grant.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

- Reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and
- Produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material for NonCommercial purposes only.
